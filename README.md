GreenGarments is a fictional company that aims to reduce environmental impact of the fashion industry by repairing and/or re-purposing technical and utilitarian garments.

GreenGarments has multiple outlet stores around the UK which sell the products.

***The application***

The web application should be a "does everything" management system for the company.

Most importantly, the application should store and manage the company database.

***Building and running the software***

The project is written using SpringBoot MVC 2.1.9.

Requirements: 

- Maven 3.5.4
- Java OpenJDK Zulu JDK 8 
- MySQL 5.7.X

An sql schema should exist locally with the name `gg`. 
The user by default is set to username `greengarment` and password `greengarment` but this can (and is recommended to) be changed.
The database user chosen must have the necessary privileges to create, modify, and drop.
